        <i>Video games are obviously a popular past time. With the growing increase in technology 
        comes the growth of popularity of video games. My favorite type of games are PC games. PC
        games have the advantage of a strong and popular fan base of people who know how to modify games
        and add on to them. Most PC games will have some "mods" available, which can vary from changing 
        just one aspect of the game, to creating a whole new games out of it. This is nice because it
        makes the life span of a game to a consumer much longer, as a user can just download a new
        mod and play for hours if they ever get bored of the main game. Also, computers are more 
        capable of playing bigger and better games than consoles, which allows for the creation
        of some crazy and interesting video games, with an ever-expanding fan base. In fact, video games
        have become so popular, there are now competitive leagues and tournaments for some games.</i>
